Cognify is an AI-powered executive function assistant designed to help users navigate overwhelming tasks by breaking them down into clear, manageable steps. It leverages a multi-agent system built with **CrewAI** and **LangChain** to provide a supportive, human-in-the-loop planning experience.

## ü§î The Problem

We all know the feeling: staring at a task that‚Äôs too big, too vague, and you don‚Äôt know where to start. This mental clutter can lead to procrastination and overwhelm. Cognify is designed to be a gentle partner in these moments, guiding you from a state of chaos to a clear, actionable plan.

## ‚ú® How It Works

Cognify uses a collaborative team of specialized AI agents to transform a user's vague goal into a concrete plan. The entire process is conversational and adaptive.

1Ô∏è‚É£ **The Clarifier Agent:** A user starts by entering a thought or goal (e.g., "I want to buy a new phone"). The Clarifier analyzes this and proposes a more specific, actionable goal (e.g., "Research and purchase a specific phone model within your budget").

2Ô∏è‚É£ **The Planner Agent:** Once the user accepts the clarified goal, the Planner, acting as a compassionate productivity coach, designs a gentle, step-by-step plan. This plan includes concrete actions and scheduled breaks to prevent burnout.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **The Refiner Agent:** Plans often need to change. The user can have a conversation with the Refiner Agent (e.g., "my budget is $500") to modify, add, or remove steps. The agent intelligently integrates the feedback, ensuring the plan remains relevant and helpful.
